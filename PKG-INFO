Description: MASTIFF is a static analysis framework that automates the
        process of extracting key characteristics from a number of different file
        formats. To ensure the framework remains flexible and extensible, a
        community-driven set of plug-ins is used to perform file analysis and data
        extraction. While originally designed to support malware, intrusion, and
        forensic analysis, the framework is well-suited to support a broader range of
        analytic needs. In a nutshell, MASTIFF allows analysts to focus on analysis
        rather than figuring out how to parse files.
Platform: Linux
